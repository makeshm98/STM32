## SCD4x CO2 sensor
***

The SCD4x is Sensirion’s next generation miniature CO2
sensor. This sensor builds on the photoacoustic sensing
principle and Sensirion’s patented PAsens® and
CMOSens® technology to offer high accuracy at an
unmatched price and smallest form factor. SMD assembly
allows cost- and space-effective integration of the sensor
combined with maximal freedom of design. On-chip signal
compensation is realized with the build-in SHT4x humidity
and temperature sensor. CO2 is a key indicator for indoor air quality as high levels
compromise humans’ cognitive low power
and well-being. The SCD4x enables smart ventilation
systems to regulate ventilation in the most energy-efficient
and human-friendly way. Moreover, indoor air quality
monitors and other connected devices based on the
SCD4x can help maintaining low CO2 concentration for a
healthy, productive environment.

## STM32 integration
***

In this project, we will be interfacing an **SCD4x** Carbondioxide, temperature and humidity sensor with the STM32 microcontroller. To visualise the output, **UART** communication is utilized to send the data over a cable to a connected PC or laptop. The result can then be observed through the console of the **STM32 IDE**.
